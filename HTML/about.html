    <p>What makes LCO unique

        LearnCodeOnline is not a marketplace for courses. It is not a startup focusing to sell courses. When we make courses, a lot of love and thought goes in. It is not about rolling out another course. For us, we want to Present best course, yet easy to understand so that we help you to change your life and love the tech, just like we do. Surely, we need to make money to run this platform, But priority is education, tech education</p>
